This piece of code performs star identification, assigns a membership statistic and aperture photometry on two provided FITs files. Image 1 must be a V filter image and image 2 must be a B filter image.
The user supplies a full width at half maximum used for the circular Gaussian fitting procedure to locate stars within both images.
Isochrones are currently fitted visually and require manual adjustment of astrophysical parameters (age, distance modulus, reddening) to best fit the observed CMD.
