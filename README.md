This Python program is designed to perform aperture photometry in the blue (B) and visual (V) bands of FITS files of moderately crowded star fields such as open clusters. Based on the DAOFIND algorithm (Stetson 1987) the code efficiently locates brightness enhancements within images, performs circular aperture photometry, extracts published data on located stars from the SIMBAD database and generates a CMD of the given star population.
Isochrones are currently fitted visually and require manual adjustment of astrophysical parameters (age, distance modulus, reddening) to best fit the observed CMD. Additional cluster membership statistics for stars based on a Bayesian approach are also included.
